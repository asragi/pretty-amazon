# pretty-amazon

This plugin enables you to get a pretty link from amazon product pages.

While amazon pages have a difficult url like `https://amazon.com/some-product-name/dp/BXXXX0000/?_somequery=somevalue&_otherquery=othervalue` ,
you can get a pretty url like `https://amazon.com/dp/BXXXX0000/` by using this plugin.
